# AI-Powered Financial Fraud Detection with Explainability


This project is an end-to-end pipeline for detecting financial fraud using machine learning and large language models (LLMs). It not only predicts fraudulent transactions with high accuracy but also explains the reasoning behind each prediction using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and natural language generated by the LLaMA-3 model via the Groq API. The solution includes a user-facing interactive dashboard built with Streamlit, enabling seamless visualization and analysis.

## Features

- **Fraud Detection:** Utilizes XGBoost trained on real transaction data.
- **Model Interpretability:** Employs SHAP to reveal feature contributions to fraud predictions.
- **Natural Language Explanation:** Generates clear, holistic explanations using a Groq-hosted LLaMA-3 model.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit for filtering, analyzing, and visualizing transactions and explanations.

## Dataset
This project uses the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) available on Kaggle. Please download the raw dataset from Kaggle and place the files in the data/raw/ folder. Processed data files are not tracked in the repository to keep it lightweight.
